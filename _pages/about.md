My research focuses on multi-robot systems at the intersection of control theory and machine learning (deep learning, reinforcement learning).
I am passionate about swarm robots with limited communication and perception but capable of autonomous planning and control in complex, dynamic environments.  
I believe in collaboration, humility, and forward-thinking in a team for fast-paced development, fulfillment of immediate milestones and robust architectures.
