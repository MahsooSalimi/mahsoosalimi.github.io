My research focuses on multi-robot systems at the intersection of control theory and machine learning (deep learning, reinforcement learning). I am passionate about swarm robots with limited communication and perception but capable of autonomous planning and control in complex, dynamic environments.<br />  
I believe in collaboration, humility, and forward-thinking in a team for fast-paced development, fulfillment of immediate milestones and robust architectures.

Interests

Machine Learning (ML) & Computer Vision (CV)<br /> 
Multi-robot Control (Autonomous Navigation, Motion Planning)<br /> 
Human-Swarm Interaction (HSI)
