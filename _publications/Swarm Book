This book presents the recent computational developments inspired by swarms in art known as swarm art and discusses applying swarm intelligence concepts 
in architecture. Non-human art is a great leap in the evolution of contemporary art, removing the requirement of an artist’s production from the creative process. Furthermore, it is a critical declaration in opposition to the anthropomorphic vision which is so destructive for all other life forms and the planet’s ecology. When accepted and integrated into human culture, non-human art done by artificial systems or machines boosts creativity and stimulates innovative fusions.
