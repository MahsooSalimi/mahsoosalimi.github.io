The application of swarm aesthetic in music composition is not new. Artistic swarm application has resulted in complex soundscapes and musical com- positions. However, sound composition using physical swarm agents has not been extensively studied. Using an experimental approach, we create a series of sound textures know as Liminal Tones (B/Rain Dream) based on swarming behaviours. We study the influence 
of different materials and emergent patterns and evaluate the acoustic properties of different materials such as wood, ceramic or granite, and effect of imperfections of the physical agents on the overall aesthetic quality. Finally, we consider the historical and theoretical foundation of swarm music, the role of materiality and actions in sound, and challenge the traditional perception of sound as an immaterial art form.<br />
