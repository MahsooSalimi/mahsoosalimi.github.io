* Our intention behind the Liminal Scape is to create an exploratory AI system in the form of an installation to present abstract emotional paintings, in which users will reveal and explore their affective states. We aim to create expressive/emotional experience, and are curious
to know what is the overall experience of the users while interacting with the system. We recognized the potential of artificial creativity for creating novel artworks supported via interactive environments in the future.<br />
