[Paper]
(https://github.com/mahsoosalimi/mahsoosalimi.github.io/blob/master/files/Exploiting%20Swarm%20Aesthetics%20in%20Sound%20Art.pdf)

We review current robotic interventions in sound art and discuss the characteristics of similar works. Then we introduce Liminal Tones (A / Autumn Swarm) â€“ a series of experimental sound compositions made by multiple mechanical objects that sync and swarm together, and generate noise music. Our goal is to investigate swarm aesthetics, and collective and emergent behaviors to create chaotic and patterned sounds.
