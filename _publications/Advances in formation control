The problem of formation in multi-robot systems has broad applications and gained considerable recognition in the past two decades among researchers. The purpose of this 
paper is to provide an overview of a new concept of learning-based control using adaptive and bio-inspired techniques in multi-robot systems. We survey recent advances in 
this research area to identify the strengths, limitations, open challenges, and research frontiers. We review the critical issues in formation control with a focus on the 
primary control strategies of different tasks (i.e., trajectory tracking, collision avoidance, etc.) In addition, we provide a comparison of the state-of-the-art in 
multi-robot formation and classify different approaches of learning-based control using artificial neural networks and bio-inspired techniques. For each approach, we analyze 
how formation can be done in different scenarios, which are considered as instances of the formation control problem, i.e., path planning, and in various application domains,
including exploration, object transportation, target tracking, etc. Finally, we discuss open challenges and offer a range of possible research directions. The goal of this 
study is to provide guidance for future research on employing learning-based control in multi-robot systems.<br />
